# Learn Programming By Cheating
This is a collection of Julia programs inspired by the idea that children love the idea of cheating. It is the thrill of doing something slightly illegal. The idea here is to make programming assignments where modifing the programs to do something they are not supposed to do is the whole point of the excercise. Basically it is a way of tricking children into learning programming.

This is a work in progress. Here are some of the ideas we will explore here:

- Figure out the password. Various programs where you got to login and write a password. Initial versions will involve reading the code to figure out what the password is. Versions of this will get progressively harder to read.

- "Bigly" is not a word. Your rich buddy in class is being reprimanded by the teacher for using the word "Bigly" in his homework all the time. He has to write "Bigly is not a word," 100 times, but is too lazy to do it. He will pay you $100 to write iti for him. Use Julia to cheat and write it 100 times to a file.

- Bank Rober. A program which simulates bank transactions which one has to modify to make sure money is siphoned off to ones own account without alerting suspicion.

- Fake Grades. The teacher has gotten a program to compute grades based on previous tests. The task here is to hack this program to push up your grade, without anybody else discovering your cheat.

- Decoy Program. In this case, reading the password out of the code is too hard. Instead the password has to be obtained by creating a fake login and then recording the login and password, when somebody else logs in.

- Too Much Homework. An evil subsitute teacher has given you too much homework. 100 additions to complete. Use Julia to fill in all the results.
